⚡️ Hybrid Forex Trading Bot Strategy (1–3 min Timeframe)
🎯 Core Goals:

Aggressively grow small accounts (compounding faster than normal).

Protect capital with dynamic risk management.

Adapt to market conditions (trend, range, breakout).

Scale position sizes automatically as balance grows.

🧠 Strategy Components
1. 📈 Trend-Following (Momentum Core)

EMA 20 + EMA 50 crossover for short-term trend direction.

ADX > 20 confirms strength (avoid weak trends).

Entry: Buy when EMA20 > EMA50 + RSI > 55, Sell when EMA20 < EMA50 + RSI < 45.

✅ Works in trending markets, captures momentum.

2. 🔄 Mean Reversion (Pullback Safety Net)

If RSI < 30 → oversold bounce (buy).

If RSI > 70 → overbought drop (sell).

Used only when ADX < 20 (weak/no trend).

✅ Avoids whipsaw in sideways/ranging markets.

3. 💥 Breakout Scalps

Look for tight consolidation (ATR very low).

Trade breakouts beyond recent high/low.

Quick scalps (1:1 risk:reward).

✅ Captures volatility bursts (common on 1–3min charts).

4. 🛡️ Risk Management & Lot Sizing

Dynamic lot size = (Balance × Risk%) ÷ (Stop Loss in pips × Pip Value)
Example: Balance $1,000, Risk 2%, SL = 10 pips → $20 risk ÷ $1/pip → 0.20 lot.

SL always placed behind key structure or ATR × multiplier.

TP is at least 1.5x SL (reward > risk).

5. 🚀 Aggressive Scaling Rule

Start with Risk = 1% per trade for safety.

When account grows by +10% → increase risk by +0.5% (up to max 5%).

If account drops by -10% → cut risk in half.

👉 This compounds growth faster when profitable, while shrinking exposure during drawdowns.

6. 📊 Trade Filtering

Skip high-spread pairs.

Exclude Gold, Silver, Oil, Synthetic, Crypto (too volatile).

Trade only major and liquid minors (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, etc.).

7. 🧩 Capital Protection

Max Daily Loss Rule: Stop trading after -5% equity drawdown in a day.

Equity Lock: If balance grows +20%, lock in half as "protected capital" (bot never risks it).

Kill Switch: If 3 consecutive stop-outs → pause trading for 1 hour.

⚡ Example Trade Flow

Bot checks EMA crossover + ADX → sees strong uptrend.

RSI confirms → Enter Buy.

Lot size auto-calculated at 2% risk of current balance.

SL = 8 pips, TP = 12 pips.

If equity +10% → next trade risks 2.5% instead.

If equity -10% → drop back to 1% risk until recovery.

🏆 Why This Combo Works

Trend: Catches big moves.

Reversion: Profits from sideways chop.

Breakouts: Exploits volatility spikes.

Scaling system: Compounds winners fast.

Risk control: Prevents blowing up account
