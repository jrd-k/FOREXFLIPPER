Got it 👍
You don’t want a single-broker code package right now — just detailed notes that you can use to design a scaling forex bot that works with any broker (Exness, IC Markets, OANDA, etc.).

Here’s the full breakdown:

📘 Notes: Efficient & Safe Forex Bot for Small Accounts
1. Broker Independence

Use APIs or MT5/MT4 Python connector (MetaTrader5 library).

Most brokers (Exness, IC Markets, Pepperstone, etc.) support MT4/MT5 → so coding for MT5 API makes bot universal.

Avoid broker-specific APIs unless you only plan to use that broker.

2. Trading Strategy Combination (1–3 Min TF)

To maximize trades per day but still protect capital:

Trend-following: Use EMA (e.g., EMA 20 vs EMA 50 crossover).

Mean reversion: RSI < 30 → buy, RSI > 70 → sell.

Breakout: Trade when price breaks key support/resistance (Bollinger Band breakout or ATR range expansion).

Scalping micro moves: Grab 2–5 pip moves when volatility spikes.

👉 The bot should run all strategies in parallel, but filter signals:

Confirm trend + RSI alignment.

Only enter on high volume or breakout.

3. Lot Size & Risk Management

Always calculate lot size dynamically:

lot_size = (account_balance * risk_percent) / stop_loss_pips


For $10 accounts, risk might be 5–10% per trade (aggressive).

For $1,000+ accounts, risk 1–2% max.

Use a minimum of 0.01 lots (most brokers’ smallest size).

Always set Stop Loss and Take Profit.

4. Scaling Small Accounts Aggressively

Small accounts grow best via compounding (profit reinvested into larger lot sizes).

Example for $10:

Risk 5% → $0.50/trade.

Stop loss = 5 pips → position size = 0.01 lots.

After balance grows → increase position size automatically.

Add equity guard:

Stop trading for the day if balance drops by 20%.

Reset at midnight server time.

5. Daily Trade Tracking

Track number of trades executed per day.

Log each trade to CSV (time, pair, lot size, result, daily PnL, cumulative PnL).

Reset trade counter every day.

Optional: show live counter in terminal (e.g., “📊 Trades today: 14”).

6. Increasing Trade Frequency

Use multiple pairs simultaneously (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, etc. → all pairs except gold/silver/oil/synthetics).

Lower timeframes (M1–M3) allow many setups per pair daily.

Smart filters prevent overtrading:

No trade if spread too wide.

No trade around major news (NFP, CPI, FOMC).

7. Safety Considerations

✅ Hard stop-loss every trade.

✅ Daily loss limit (e.g., stop trading if account drops 20% in a day).

✅ Max open trades (avoid 10 trades at once on a $10 account).

✅ News filter (pause before red news events).

8. Best Practices

Backtest on demo before live.

Start with micro lot sizes (0.01).

Keep logs of trades → review to refine strategy.

Scale risk down as account grows (don’t keep risking 10% forever).

📊 Example Workflow

Bot wakes up at market open → scans all pairs.

Finds signals (EMA trend + RSI alignment + breakout).

Calculates lot size based on balance & risk.

Executes trade with SL + TP.

Updates:

✅ Trade count today

✅ Daily profit/loss

✅ Cumulative stats

Stops trading if:

Daily loss limit hit, OR

Broker account equity guard triggered.

⚡ With this setup, a $10 account can take many small trades per day (scalping mode), while protecting capital with:

Smart lot sizing

Daily equity guard

Trade count & PnL monitoring

📝 Raw Notes: Forex Bot Strategy for Small Accounts (Scalping 1–3 min TF)
1. Broker Independence

Use MT4/MT5 API (works with most brokers → Exness, IC Markets, OANDA, Pepperstone).

Avoid broker-locked APIs.

Core engine should connect via MT5 Python library.

2. Combined Trading Strategy

Trend-following: EMA(20) vs EMA(50) → direction bias.

Mean reversion: RSI < 30 = oversold (buy), RSI > 70 = overbought (sell).

Breakout: Bollinger Band / ATR-based volatility breakout.

Micro-scalp: Capture 2–5 pips during volatility spikes.

Filter: Only trade when at least 2–3 signals align.

3. Lot Size & Risk

Formula:

lot_size = (balance * risk%) / (stop_loss_pips * pip_value)


Min lot = 0.01 (depending on broker).

Small accounts (< $50): risk 5–10% per trade (aggressive).

Larger accounts: reduce to 1–2%.

Always use SL & TP.

4. Scaling Small Accounts

Use compounding: increase lot size automatically as balance grows.

$10 example:

Risk 5% = $0.50/trade.

SL = 5 pips → ~0.01 lots.

Equity guard:

Stop trading if balance drops -20% in a day.

Resume next day.

5. Trade Count (Daily Tracking)

Track # of trades per day.

Reset counter daily (server time).

Print/log each trade → Trades today: X.

Save logs: pair, lot, result, profit/loss, cumulative stats.

6. Increasing Frequency

Trade multiple pairs (exclude gold, silver, oil, synthetics).

M1–M3 timeframes → many signals.

Avoid overtrading:

Skip when spreads widen.

Pause before red news events.

7. Safety

Hard SL on every trade.

Daily loss cap (e.g., 20%).

Max open trades (avoid over-leverage on tiny accounts).

No trading during high-impact news.

8. Best Practices

Backtest first on demo.

Use micro-lots to test live.

Track results daily → refine strategy.

Reduce risk % as account grows (protect profits).

9. Example Bot Workflow

Scan all pairs → check signals (EMA, RSI, breakout).

Confirm alignment → generate trade idea.

Calculate lot size via balance & risk.

Place order with SL/TP.

Update trade counter + logs.

Stop if:

Daily loss limit hit, OR

Equity guard breached.

⚡ Goal = Aggressive scaling with safety nets

Many small trades per day (scalping).

Risk dynamically adjusted.

Account protected by equity guard + daily loss cap
